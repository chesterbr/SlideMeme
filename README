SlideMeme was a hack created during the Yahoo! Open Hack Day Brazil 2010, which allows users to post slides from SlideShare to Yahoo! Meme (by converting them to animated GIFs).

It requires the installation of the freeware SWF to Image ActiveX Library, which can be downloaded at http://bytescout.com/download/download_freeware.html. Yes, it means you need a Windows Server to run it - one possible evolution would be to port that part to swfrender (http://wiki.swftools.org/index.php/Swfrender) to kill that dependency.

This project contains both the back-end code (the ASP and PHP pages, the later being the entry point), the bookmarklet payload (within the js folder) and the index.html file that makes the bookmarklet avalable. Related image and stylesheet files were also uplaoded, allowing a third party to fully reproduce the site.

There is no test/deploy process (it was a 24-hour hack), but one should be able to setup IIS, the ActiveX mentioned above and run it (maybe switching URLs from slide.memethis.com to the new address).

Details about each component can be found in Portuguese at http://chester.blog.br/archives/2010/03/slidememe.html (reasonably machine-translated here: http://bit.ly/dsIUoU). The version on that blog post still used PHP code to decode the slide URLs, the current one already uses the YQL table.
