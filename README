SlideMeme was a hack created during the Yahoo! Open Hack Day Brazil 2010, which allows users to post slides from SlideShare to Yahoo! Meme (by converting them to animated GIFs).

It uses swfrender and ImageMagick to do the conversion (formerly it needed a Windows Server, but that changed after the Hack Day, and now it runs on any Linux-like machine with that software installed.)

This project contains both the back-end code (a single PHP page), the bookmarklet payload (within the js folder) and the index.html file that makes the bookmarklet avalable. Related image and stylesheet files were also uplaoded, allowing a third party to fully reproduce the site, if desired.

There is no test/deploy process (it was a 24-hour hack), but one should be able to setup and run it (maybe switching URLs from slide.memethis.com to the new address).

Details about each component can be found in Portuguese at http://chester.blog.br/archives/2010/03/slidememe.html (reasonably machine-translated here: http://bit.ly/dsIUoU). The version on that blog post still used PHP code to decode the slide URLs and an ASP page/ActiveX component, the current one already uses the YQL table to get the slides and a single PHP for everything else.
